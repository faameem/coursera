** Emotions --> Appraisal (judgement +ve/-ve) --> body reaction --> response
  - response can be to suppress body reaction; judge emotion differently; or change the situation
** Negativity Bias
** Positive Offset (more positivity in ones life than negativity but it gets ignored, as the fish doesn't see the water)
** Positive Emotions
** Positive emotions are triggered by our interpretations of our current circumstances, 
  whereas pleasure is what we get when we give the body what it needs right now. 
  If you’re thirsty, water tastes really good; if you’re cold, it feels good to wrap your coat around you. 
  Pleasures tell us what the body needs. 
  Positive emotions tell us not just what the body needs but what we need mentally and emotionally 
  and what our future selves might need. 
  They help us broaden our minds and our outlook and build our resources down the road. 
  I call it the “broaden-and-build” effect.
